## Description: This was created as a way to monitor the volume of someone's microphone and give them a warning when they get too loud. It has several applications, but the main one is to prevent the user from being too loud when their family members are asleep, as an example.

To run, open up any command line and run
``` py main.py ``` or doule click the main.py file in file explorer.
